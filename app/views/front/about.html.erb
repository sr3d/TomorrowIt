    <b><span class='colored'>TomorrowIt.com</span></b> is developed by <a href="http://alexle.net">Alex Le</a> as a utility for personal use.  The tasks list idea is not new, but everyone has his or her own approach.  Some likes "Get Things Done" and be super organized.  Some just likes a simple, minimal list.  I happen to fall into the latter group.<br/>
    <br/>
    The goal of <b><span class='colored'>TomorrowIt.com</span></b> is to keep everything as simple as possible.  The lack of features is a feature itself.  Most of the time, personally I just want to be able to write down and track what I need to do with minimal steps, and TomorrowIt.com is built around this simplicty.<br/>
    <br/>
    If you like it, great!  It's free, so go head and tell your friends about it too.  Ideas and suggestions please send to alexnhatle at yahoo.com.
